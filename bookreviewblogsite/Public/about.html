    <p>My name is Yeabsira Desta, and I currently work as an Infrastructure Engineer at Discover Financial Services. Alongside my professional endeavors, I take pride in being a devoted mother to three boys and a supportive partner to my wonderful husband. Reflecting on my journey, I find that this class has been particularly demanding and difficult at times. However, through perseverance and dedication, I have embraced the challenges it presented. Despite the obstacles, I can confidently say that I have gained invaluable knowledge and skills from this experience. Each hurdle has served as an opportunity for growth, and I am grateful for the lessons learned along the way.</p>
